Cyclingweatherapp is a project originally created as a student project for the University of Helsinki Department of Computer Science during the summer term 2015.  The intended purpose of the application is to provide bicyclers and pedestrians current information about routes and conditions. Information about maps and bicycling routes is received from Google Maps. Some weather information is received from Finnish Meteorological Institute. 

Information is also meant to be gathered by different devices carried around by users of the application. Application has tools to add different devices to gather different forms of information.  Currently application gathers and displays only information about temperature, but it is designed to be easy to configure to receive and visualize other information such as air quality.

Software is a web application implemented with Ruby on Rails on the server side. Angular.js is used on the browser. Data is visualized using GDAL library. Beta version of the Thingsee One device was used to gather data during the development of the application.
